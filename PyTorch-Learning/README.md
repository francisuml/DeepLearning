"Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence." — Abigail Adams


### Customization Tips:
1. Replace placeholder links with your actual notebook paths
2. Add/remove sections based on your focus areas
3. Update the progress tracking as you complete topics
4. Add your own learning notes or insights
5. Include a license if you plan to share publicly

Would you like me to add any specific sections like:
- A cheat sheet of common PyTorch operations?
- A troubleshooting guide for common errors?
- Detailed explanations of key concepts?
