# DeepLearningDeep Learning Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my Deep Learning Repository! This repository serves as a personal space to document my learning journey in deep learning, showcase projects, and share experiments using various deep learning frameworks and techniques. It is a collection of code, notebooks, and resources aimed at exploring and mastering deep learning concepts.

## Purpose

**Learning**: Store tutorials, notes, and exercises as I progress through deep learning topics.<br>
**Projects**: Host implementations of deep learning models, including neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.<br>
**Experimentation**: Experiment with datasets, architectures, and optimization techniques to deepen my understanding.

## Contents
This repository will include:

- Jupyter notebooks with code examples and explanations.
- Project files (e.g., Python scripts, model architectures, and datasets).
- Visualizations and performance analyses of deep learning models.
- Documentation and insights gained from each project or study.

## Installation
To run the code and experiments in this repository, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/deeplearning.git`
`cd deeplearning`

### Install DependenciesEnsure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Install the required libraries using pip:
`pip install tensorflow torch numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter`

- Adjust the list based on specific project requirements (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).

### Set Up Environment (Optional)

Consider using a virtual environment:
`python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate`

Install GPU support if needed (e.g., CUDA for TensorFlow or PyTorch).

## Usage

**Explore Notebooks**: Open .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run code and view explanations.
**Run Projects**: Execute Python scripts or notebooks with the appropriate dataset and dependencies.
**Contribute**: Feel free to add your own experiments or improve existing code.

Current Projects

- Heart Disease Classification with TensorFlow

Check the repository over time for updates as I add more projects.

Learning Resources
I will reference and include materials from:

Online courses (e.g., Coursera, Udemy).
Books (e.g., "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville).
Documentation from TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other frameworks.
